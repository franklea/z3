Module Name:

    assertion_stack.h

Abstract:

    It should be viewed as the "goal" object for incremental solvers.
    The main difference is the support of push/pop operations.  Like a
    goal, an assertion_stack contains expressions, their proofs (if
    proof generation is enabled), and dependencies (if unsat core
    generation is enabled).

    The assertions on the stack are grouped by scope levels. Scoped
    levels are created using push, and removed using pop. 

    Assertions may be "committed". Whenever a push is executed, all
    "uncommitted" assertions are automatically committed. 
    Only uncommitted assertions can be simplified/reduced.

    An assertion set has a limited model converter that only supports
    definitions (for constant elimination) and filters (for fresh
    symbols introduced by tactics).

    Some tactics support assertion_stacks and can be applied to them.
    However, a tactic can only access the assertions on the top level.
    The assertion stack also informs the tactic which declarations 
    can't be eliminated since they occur in the already committed part.
